<!--Problem Statement: In an era where digital learning is becoming increasingly prevalent, 
the traditional text-based delivery of educational content can fail to fully engage students.
 This assignment challenges you to incorporate multimedia elements into an HTML document
  designed to teach a simple concept (e.g., the water cycle, basic math principles, 
  or a historical event), thereby improving the learner's engagement and understanding.


Task 1: Embed an Educational Image Create an HTML page and embed an image that illustrates 
the concept you're teaching.

Add a caption using the <figcaption> element to describe the image.

Expected Outcome: A web page displaying an image relevant to the educational content, 
with a caption explaining the image.



Task 2: Include an Instructional Audio Clip Embed an audio clip that provides a brief explanation or reading of the concept. Ensure the audio is accessible with playback controls.

Expected Outcome: A web page with an embedded audio clip that plays an explanation of the chosen concept, complete with controls for play, pause, and volume.

Task 3: Integrate an Informative Video Incorporate a video that visually explains the concept. The video could be a lecture, an animation, or a documentary clip related to the topic.

Expected Outcome: A web page featuring a video that provides a comprehensive explanation or visualization of the concept, enhancing the learner's understanding through visual and auditory stimulation.

Completion Criteria:

The HTML document must include at least one example of each multimedia element (image, audio, video) related to the educational content.
Each multimedia element must be appropriately captioned or described to aid understanding.
The page should be structured semantically,
 with clear headings and descriptive text accompanying each multimedia element 
 to contextualize its relevance to the educational content.-->
